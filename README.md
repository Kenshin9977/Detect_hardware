# Detect ASIC Encoder

This software's goal is to detect if your system has any asic encoder wether it is QuickSync (Intel), NVENC (NVIDIA) or VCE (AMD) and to list their capabilities.
I used those ressources to get a detailed list :
- [NVENC] (https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-gpu-support-matrix)
- [QuickSync] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HD_Graphics)
- [VCE] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Coding_Engine)

## How to use

Just download the latest version in the [release tab](https://github.com/Kenshin9977/Detect_hardware/releases), extract the archive then double click on the start.bat.
After a short time you'll get the list of asic encoders on your system.
